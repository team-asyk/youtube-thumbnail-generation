## 1. Description
This tool is composed of 4 steps: 
### 1 ) Frame Sampling
Video frames are sampled and saved to decrease the processing load.


### 2 ) Emotion Recognition
[Face](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/) [2] provided by Microsoft recognizes emotion of the video frames, and the most emotionally rich frame is extracted as the background image.

### 3 ) Image Insertion
Images of Representative objects are searched on Google and the best one is inserted to the background image after the background is made transparent and trimmed. Background transparency is performed by [remove.bg API](https://www.remove.bg/) [3] provided by KALEIDO.

### 4 ) Text Insertion
The character string generated by [TSUNA](https://cl.asahi.com/api_data/headlinegeneration.html) [4] provided by ASAHI Shimbun Media Lab is inserted to the background image.
